# vk-parser
This is VK-Parser with API VK. My first distribution on GitHub. 

This project was created for parsing information from open sources, such as VK.
The following functions are performed:
1. Collecting complete information from the goal page.
2. Collecting information about subscriptions is the goal.
3. Collecting information about the target's friends.
4. Collecting photos from target's page.

A primary analysis of the city and university is also available using information from the goal page, its subscriptions and friends.

Development continues, suggestions and criticism are accepted.

ABOUT PROGRAM:

This program uses the VK API version 5.131.
